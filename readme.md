- Since I really familiar with antd and to save much time, I decided to use it.
- List of users is part of filter.
- Each detail user information can be seen by clicking on the user full name.
- Each detail photo information can be seen by clicking on the image.
- Each comments can be seen by clicking on the detail post. Hover the comment to show edit or delete icon.
- The comment is persist even after user changes another page, create new comment, edit and delete (not reload).
- Since create new comment need email, so I made them randomly.
